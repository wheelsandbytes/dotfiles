## .zshrc

my zsh configuration uses powerlevel10k and a few plugins:

powerlevel10k found [here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

zsh-syntax-highlighing can be found [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

zsh-autosuggestions can be found [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

### why not oh-my-zsh?

oh-my-zsh has a much bigger set of features, but it's also slower to start, as a result. installing powerlevel10k and the plugins manually yields a lightning-fast prompt when opening a new shell.


## .vimrc

my vim setup is a bit messy, and uses a mixture of plugins installed via [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), and via manual install (vim 8+ has built-in plugin support)
